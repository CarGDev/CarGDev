<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
I am a Mechatronics Engineer and a Node.js Backend Developer, passionate about continuous learning and all things related to technology. I love contributing to the open-source community.

At iVoyant, I am actively working on the AT&T/Cricket Wireless project, where I contribute to designing, developing, and maintaining high-performance software solutions. My responsibilities include:

‚Ä¢ Assessing operational feasibility by analyzing requirements, defining problems, and proposing scalable solutions.  
‚Ä¢ Writing and maintaining unit and integration test cases for microservices to ensure reliability.  
‚Ä¢ Deploying microservices on Kubernetes in both preproduction and production environments.  
‚Ä¢ Enhancing UI components using React, HTML, and CSS to improve user experience.  
‚Ä¢ Managing UI deployments on Linux servers and maintaining Bash scripts for automation.  

Previously at Tortoise, I led the migration from jQuery to Angular 12, modernizing web applications with responsive designs. I also worked on backend development, including API creation and real-time status updates. My commitment to clean, efficient code is reflected in the seamless experiences I build for users and clients.

Interested in collaborating? Feel free to reach out!
